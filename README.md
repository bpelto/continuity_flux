Scripts pertaining to ice flux paper

- **Surface_vel_boxplots**: Create boxplots of surface ice velocity comparing our feature-tracking derived ice velocity mosacis for each year to ITS_LIVE ice velcocity msacis.
- **firn_models**: Firn model code to determine the mean annual temperature for each flux bin, which combined with mean annual accumulation is fed into a firn model to determine firn column thickness and density.
- **flux_gate-Conrad**: Code to run the flux gate flowline model for Conrad Glacier.
- **flux_gate-Kokanee**:  Code to run the flux gate flowline model for Kokanee Glacier.
- **residuals**: Create a kernel density estimation plot of mass balance residuals.
